Garment Worker Productivity Prediction





This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the productivity of garment workers. Accurate productivity predictions can help garment manufacturers optimize production processes, improve efficiency, and maximize profits.

Project Overview
The project involves training various regression models to predict the productivity of garment workers based on relevant features. The Flask framework is used to develop a simple front-end interface for interaction with the machine learning models.

Models Used
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated for productivity prediction:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
AdaBoost Regressor
Technologies Used
Frontend: Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
Backend: Python (Flask for API integration)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
